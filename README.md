4. Create a bot on Telegram

✅ 1. Create a bot via BotFather
- Open Telegram and search for: BotFather
- Write to it: /start
- Then type: /newbot
- Provide a name and username (must end with bot)
- You will receive a bot token > Write down this token - you will need it in the next step.

✅ 2. Open a browser and type the address:

https://api.telegram.org/botyour_token/getUpdates

🔁 Replace your_token with the one you got from BotFather.

✅ 3. Send a message to your bot
- Search for your bot in Telegram (by username).
- Write to it e.g. test.
- Now refresh the page with the getUpdates link.

✅ 4. Find chat_id

In response you will see something like this (in JSON format):

```{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "update_id": <id>,
      "message": {
        "message_id": 1,
        "from": {
          "id": <chatid>,
          ...
        },
        "chat": {
          "id": <chatid>,
          "first_name": "Yourname",
          "type": "private"
        },
        "text": "test"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
👉 This chat.id field (here: <chatid>) is your chat_id.
